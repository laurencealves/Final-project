##**syn·es·the·sia**
####noun
####	1	the production of a sense impression relating to one sense or part of the body by stimulation of another sense or part of the body. 


**Summary**

The project consists in an installation involving body movement, music and projection. The intention with this project is to create a symphony of senses making the user perceive their senses as a unity. In the installation the users will receive a bracelet and enter a space, there, they will start moving their bodies and each movement is going to turn into a sound, so the each person will have a unique music representing their bodies and how they move in space. Also, all the movements are going to be projected in a wall creating a draw in the end for each person. The bracelet is a wearable with an accelerometer inside. This bracelet will allow the computer to understand the direction of the person in space. Giving this direction, each coordinate will activate a sound and a projection in the wall. The body turned into sound, sound turned into an image. Movement, hearing and sight all together creating a unique experience for each user.


**Component parts** 

1. wearable -   Flora (from adafruit)

2. wearable - accelerometer

3. wearable - case (3D printed)

4. sound speaker

5. projector

**Challenges**

For sure, the hardest part will be computing the data from the wearable to turn it into sounds. Understand how each new movement turns into a new sound and making it the most organic sound as possible. I want the music to be fluid, like normal music, not robotic sounds that don’t “communicate” with each other. 

**Project timeline**

*week 1* - research and assemble components to start building

*week 2* - start coding and computing the data from the prototype with the accelerometer

*week 3* - coding the movement with music and first test

*week 4* - coding the movement with music/ coding the projection part / more testing 

*week 5* - final coding / assemble all part together and simulate the whole installation / test with users
